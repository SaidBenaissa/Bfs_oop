BFS, or Breadth-First Search, is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore all the vertices and edges of a graph in breadthward motion. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs or for exploring the structure of a network.

The BFS algorithm starts at a chosen source vertex and proceeds to explore all the neighboring vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices in the next level. The process is repeated until all the vertices in the graph have been visited.

Here's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm:

1- Initialize an empty queue and mark the source vertex as visited.

2 - Add the source vertex to the queue.

3 - While the queue is not empty:

  1. Dequeue the next vertex from the queue.

  2. Visit all the neighboring vertices of the dequeued vertex that have not been visited.

  3. Mark these neighboring vertices as visited and enqueue them.

The BFS algorithm is widely used in many applications, such as network analysis, pathfinding, and artificial intelligence. It is particularly effective for solving problems that require finding the shortest path between two points in an unweighted graph.
